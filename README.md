# IPFS Pubsub Chatroom

This application is a basic create-react-app with some ui sugar from [Material-UI](https://material-ui-next.com/)

It's as minimal as possible and intended to serve as a basis for consumption of IPFS Pubsub. There will be updates down the line to support GossipSub (right now IPFS Pubsub is running on FloodSub), encrypted messaging, and other goodies as pubsub continues to evolve over time.

Please use Chrome, Brave, or Mozilla when running this.

To install:
```
yarn
```

To build:
```
yarn build
```
**Note: This will give you an error `./node_modules/cids/src/index.js:24`, but this can be ignored, it will not affect the app.**

To run:
```
npm run start
```

Here's a video of it working in an incognito chrome tab, a normal chrome tab, and a brave tab.
